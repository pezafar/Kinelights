# KINELIGHTS



## Description
Kinelight is a project aiming at controlling stage equipment (lights mainly, using DMX protocol) with hand movements (in addition to a physical glove).

This repository hosts the software part, written in JAVA.
This code aims at handling gestures inputs from the glove, DMX communication, equipment, and clock for music synchronisation. 


The DMX communication has been handled with a Enttec interface, DMX frames being sent by serial.

## About

The code will not run by itself, as the other part of the project are not linked, but someone might be interested in it.

This project has been done at Télécom Paris, as a first year engineering school project.
